	   <p>The Autism Awareness Team aims to help people understand and gain further knowledge on the topic of Autism. Spreading awareness is our job - after all, "Autism Awareness" is our middle name (literally!!).</p>
	   <h1><i>You're not alone, </i></h1>
	   <h1><i>we understand you.</i></h1> 
	   <h4><i>Our job is for you to walk out</i></h4>
		   <h4><i>having learned something new.</i></h4>
     <p>Ok, so first of all - what even is autism? Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability, which occurs due to some differences in the brain. This affects areas of interactions, communication, learning and behaviour. You can visit our "What is Autism" page for more information (link located on the navigator at the very top of this page). </p>
	   <p>Well, what do we do? What is our purpose? Our purpose is to help people understand what Autism is, as well as get more information on it. Although we do not provide any services for people with Autism themselves, we try our best to give you the information you need to be able to communicate and potentially help Autistic people. We do this through various types of events, including but not limited to; games, speeches, meditation sessions, questionnaires, ventilation sessions, etc. </p>
	   
	   <h3>The Team</h3>
	   <p>Our team consists of our four main roles. Here is a little bit about us!!</p>

	   <p>We believe that you are the key to moving our group forward - after all, itâ€™s not the business that is in charge of the movement - it depends on the people (you!!) who support us on our journey. </p>
