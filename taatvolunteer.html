		<p>You can help us keep our mission of awareness in action. You may not think that your support is worth much, but we’d disagree. Helping our events means more and more through each individual person’s contribution.  </p>
	   <p>And no, just because you want to join once, does not mean you have to join every time. Volunteering is about your personal want to help out - it means you do not have to participate every time if you do once. We do not have any intention to force you to stay or volunteer, as this is your own personal choice. </p>
	   <h3>Joining our Team</h3>
	   <p>If you want to join, you will need to let us know at least 3 days before the event. We are very strict on schedules, and will sadly not be able to accept any late requests to help out. You can contact us to add you to our list of volunteers, and will be holding a meeting two days before the event (online, on zoom) to organise roles and responsibilities for each person. You are more than welcome to come to our meeting two days before and find out that you will not be able to join <strong>before</strong> we organise our jobs. Any later cannot be accepted.
