		<h4> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability, which occurs due to some differences in the brain. This affects areas of interactions, communication, learning and behaviour.</h4>
	   <p>Some common behaviours of people with autism (not all!!); </p>
<ul> 
	   <li>Over or under sensitivity to touch , sound and/or smell </li>  
	<li>Repetitive behaviours </li>
	<li>Getting upset over unfamiliar situations </li>
	<li>Feeling anxious at social events/situations </li> 
<li>Taking longer to process new information </li>
	   </ul>
	   <h3>Remember!!</h3>
	   <p>Not all people with Autism are the same — some Autistic people may need little to no support, while others require daily assistance from a parent/carer. </p>
	  <h3>A Mini History Lesson</h3>
	   <p>Asperger’s Disorder was a term used in the past for people who had milder symptoms of ASD - it was similar to the high-functioning level of Autism. However, this term no longer officially exists as a diagnosable disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association. People now believe that ASD shouldn’t have any branch offs in terms of its name and different levels, but rather should be accepted as one big community. </p>
